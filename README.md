## About Me 🚀

I'm a Junior Software Developer driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for solving problems through code. I thrive in collaborative environments, value strong communication, and enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others grow.

I have hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development, and I’m currently expanding my skills through the ALX Software Engineering Program, where I’m focused on full-stack development.

Core Skills:

✅ Python Programming
✅ HTML & CSS (Front-End Development)
✅ Team collaboration & knowledge sharing
Whether it's building clean, user-friendly interfaces or writing efficient backend logic, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.
